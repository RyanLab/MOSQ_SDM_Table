This small repo is designed to hold a csv file called "MOSQ_SDM_Supp.csv", which is a data table of information containing metadata about studies of mosquito SDMs pulled from the literature, for a systematic review. 
Intended to be a static tabulation to accompany a publication on this topic, we, the authors, felt it would serve the audience better to keep it on GitHub than as a supplementary online table in a journal.
